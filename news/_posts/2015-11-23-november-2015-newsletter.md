Hi everyone! It's been a while since the last newsletter went out, but I've finally got around to writing another one. In the future, newsletters will probably number 2 or fewer per month, plus important update and security announcements. Introduction, explanation.

First, we start with a newly released project from docker that uses Cuberite: [Dockercraft](https://github.com/docker/dockercraft) is a project that connects minecraft in-game with docker containers on other servers. This uses Cuberite with a custom plugin. Check out their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dockercraft) and have a try!

The Cuberite [User's Manual](https://github.com/cuberite/users-manual) has had a major update and the introduction for beginner users is now functionally complete. The manual has also been optimised for printing, with a new stylesheet and image improvements. You should try it out! Suggestions and new content are always welcome to be submitted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cuberite/users-manual).

The [main website](http://cuberite.org) has been improved, with a new layout contributed by [@mathias-github](https://github.com/mathias-github). This will hopefully make it easier for new users to get started with the project, as well as display the surrounding services more clearly. Contributions are, as always, welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite.github.io).
