Hello everyone! To celebrate 1000 stars on GitHub, we're arranging a meetup at a [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) in Germany. At the meetup, you will meet other members of the Cuberite community, learn how to write plugins, contribute to discussions about Cuberite's development, implement new features in Cuberite and more. There is an  [agenda](https://github.com/cuberite/MeetupAgenda2016) of things to do, but it isn't final yet. Feel free to suggest something you want to do.

The meetup will happen on the 19th to 21st of February at the address "Das Labor Alleestra√üe 50, 44793 Bochum, Germany". We will not be able to pay for accommodation, which means you'll have to find a place to stay at yourself. If you're planning on attending the meetup, please [mark off the days you are available to meet up](http://doodle.com/poll/ywaucxvcyzstt36z), so we know how many people that are interested.

If you aren't available to meet up, don't worry. Everything will be streamed on either YouTube or Twitch.
