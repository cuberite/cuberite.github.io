 - If you are interested in developing Cuberite core or plugins, please do not hesitate to join the [forum](https://forum.cuberite.org) or [Discord server](https://discord.gg/76w5J6M). Cuberite development has slowed down a bit due to lack of free time among regular contributors, as well as larger changes in Minecraft 1.13 and 1.14, so any new contributions are greatly appreciated.
