A few years ago, there was a possibility to run Cuberite on Android with our Android app. As development on Cuberite continued, the app was unintentionally left behind due to several issues. We are happy to announce that users will be able to run Cuberite on Android again, by using our new and improved Android app. It is not ready for release quite yet, but we expect to make it available in the beginning of 2017.

In other news, a few [stability issues](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/pull/3439) related to player handling have been fixed, thanks to [xoft](https://github.com/madmaxoft). In addition to many bug fixes and improvements, players can now use the spectator mode of Minecraft without issues, and work has started on Minecraft 1.11 support for Cuberite.
