Hi everyone! This is the December 2015 edition of the Cuberite newsletter.

The Cuberite server hit a big milestone this month, when we reached the 1000 star mark on GitHub, as well as getting close to the ten-thousandth commit. This just shows how much the community has been involved in the creation of the server.

Mobs have also had a lot of improvements this month, including a new system for breeding implemented by [Gargaj](https://github.com/Gargaj), and improvements to pathfinding from [LogicParrot](https://github.com/LogicParrot).

[tigerw](https://github.com/tigerw) has refactored the redstone simulator, with improvements to speed and some bugfixes. He made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q-nmkelEDI) to demonstrate the new system.

We also have a new [donation system](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/cuberite) so that you can help out with hosting costs for our servers, and also set up bounties for issues that you want to get fixed. You can donate with a credit card or Bitcoin.

TLS has been enabled on many sites, including the [newsletter](https://newsletter.cuberite.org/), the [user's manual](https://book.cuberite.org/), and the [buildserver](https://builds.cuberite.org/).

Mac OSX and FreeBSD are now supported platforms, and builds are available from the [buildserver](https://builds.cuberite.org/). Thanks to [sphinxc0re](https://github.com/sphinxc0re) who provided the build slaves for those platforms.
