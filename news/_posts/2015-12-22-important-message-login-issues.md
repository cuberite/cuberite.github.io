It has come to our attention that Mojang has changed the certificate on the session servers. This means that players will not have been able to log in to your servers.

We have pushed out a fix and downloading the latest version of the server should resolve the issue.

Build downloads are available from the [homepage](http://cuberite.org/).

Thank you for your patience!
