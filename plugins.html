<p>Plugins are an easy way to expand your server's functionality. There are many different first and third-party plugins available. Adding a plugin to your server is simple; you download a plugin, extract it to the <b>Plugins</b> folder inside your <b>Server</b> folder, and activate the plugin in the WebAdmin panel of your server.</p> 
<p>You can find plugins for Cuberite in the <a href="https://cuberiteplugins.azurewebsites.net/">plugin repository</a> or the <a href="http://forum.mc-server.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=2">forum</a>.</p>
