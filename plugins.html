<p>Plugins are an easy way to expand your server's functionality. There are many different first and third-party plugins available. Adding a plugin to your server is simple; you download a plugin, extract it to the <b>Plugins</b> folder inside your <b>Server</b> folder, and activate the plugin in the WebAdmin panel of your server.</p>
